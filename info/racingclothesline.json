    "description": "Racing Clothesline is my personal blog that I started in 2014 to share news and opinions about my favourite motorsport: Formula One. It uses the Wordpress CMS and uses a fully designed custom theme that I designed from scratch. On the website, I'm fortunate enough to have a media relationship with every team and to have conducted interviews with drivers on a few occasions. In 2019, the website was expanded to cover the new W Series, a female-only motorsport series.",
