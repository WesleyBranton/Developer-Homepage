    "description": "SUMO Live Helper is a browser add-on designed for volunteers of Mozilla. It was created by a Mozilla contributor as a utility to monitor new support questions and notify volunteers, helping to increase the responsiveness of the community. I joined the project in 2019, helping to completely rewrite the add-on. I also implemented a number of features and optimizations as well as support for Firefox's Android browser.",
