    "description": "Grandfather Fox is a simple Firefox browser add-on that brings the chimes of a grandfather clock to Firefox. Users can set the volume and style of chime that's played every hour. While it's mainly just a fun project, it can also help people that find themselves losing track of time and spending far too much time on the internet.",
