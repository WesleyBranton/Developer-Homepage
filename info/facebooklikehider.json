    "description": "I designed this Firefox browser add-on originally just for myself to stop notifications about \"likes\" received on my posts and comments from appearing in my Facebook notifications feed. When I discovered that other people wanted the same functionality, I released the add-on to the public. It has since been expanded to allow users to hide the \"like\" counter and \"like\" buttons. This helps to combat social media addiction and it's a feature that Facebook has implemented itself on other platforms like Instagram.",
